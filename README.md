* The Urban city's average fare per ride and average fare per driver were lower because there were more total drivers than rides
* The Rural ity's low number of total drivers is the reason for the high average fare per driver

### Total Fare By City Type

* The fare began to rise for all three city types in late February
* The Urban city had a longer peak than the other city types
* The Rural city's fare began to rise again during April

## Summary
* Pyber could expand the data to include distance per trip to maybe show why the fares are lower in the Urban city
* It may be helpful to either let go some of their drivers in the Urban city or find a way to get more riders
* Finding a way to get more riders could include advertising when the total fares begin to increase
